  title = {Shape-{{Aware Line Generalisation With Weighted Effective Area}}},
  abstract = {Few line generalisation algorithms provide explicit control over the style of generalisation that results. In this paper we introduce weighted effective area, a set of area-based metrics for cartographic line generalisation following the bottom-up approach of the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm. Various weight factors are used to reflect the flatness, skewness and convexity of the triangle upon which the Visvalingam-Whyatt effective area is computed. Our experimental results indicate these weight factors may provide much greater control over generalisation effects than is possible with the original algorithm. An online web demonstrator for weighted effective area has been set up.},
